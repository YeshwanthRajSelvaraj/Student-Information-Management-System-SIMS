## üì¶ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have a web server stack installed (e.g., [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YeshwanthRajSelvaraj/Student-Information-Management-System.git
    ```
    Move the cloned folder to your server's root directory (e.g., `xampp/htdocs/`).

3.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Open your PHPMyAdmin panel (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    *   Create a new database named `student_info`.
    *   Import the provided SQL schema from `SQL DB Dump.txt` into your new database.

4.  **Configuration:**
    *   Open the `config.php` file.
    *   Update the database credentials if your local MySQL setup differs from the default.
    ```php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root"; // Your MySQL username
    $password = ""; // Your MySQL password
    $dbname = "student_info";
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
